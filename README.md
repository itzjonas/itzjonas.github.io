# 🕹️ Decoding JSON: A JS Web Canvas 🎨

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, a totally tubular web canvas for my front-end explorations, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Get ready to plug into the neon-soaked world of 80s-inspired web dev!

## 💾 Getting Started

Fire up the development server and get ready to jam:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Cruise on over to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to witness the magic! ✨

Start tweaking the digital landscape by modding `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates in real-time, like a high score popping up on your favorite arcade game! 👾

This project harnesses the power of [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P), a pixelated font that's straight out of the 8-bit era. 🕹️

## 🚧 Work in Progress! 🚧

Currently, this is a temporary landing page while the main site is under construction. Check back soon for more radical updates!
